New Little World School Website
Welcome to the New Little World School website repository! This project includes a fully functional website for our school, designed to provide essential information and facilitate communication with our community. The site features a welcoming Home page, an informative About page, and a user-friendly Contact page. Additionally, we have integrated an SMTP mailer to handle enquiry form submissions seamlessly, ensuring that all queries from prospective parents and students are promptly addressed. The website is hosted and live at https://newlittleworldpreschool.000webhostapp.com/ . Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or customize it to suit your needs. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!
